This is a practice repository created as part of the **Boot.dev** backend development curriculum. 

### Project Purpose
The goal of this project was to master the fundamentals of version control using **Git and GitHub**. Through this project, I practiced:
* **Atomic Commits:** Writing clear, concise commit messages.
* **Branching & Merging:** Managing different lines of development.
* **Rebasing:** Maintaining a clean project history.
* **Remote Integration:** Syncing local development with GitHub.
